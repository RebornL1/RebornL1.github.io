# MVC

- ## Concept 

    - **Model** -> **What** is your app about.
    - **Controller** -> **How** your program appears on screen.
    - **View** -> **minions** of your Controller, These are very generic UI elements, like UI button, the UI view controller even UI label.
    - ***All those kind of generic things, UI things, that the Controller has to communicate with the Model to get what is going on your app onto the UI.* ** 

- ## Communication

    1.  **`Controller to * ` **

        Controller can communicate with each Model and View, absolutely it's supposed to do that things.

    2.  **`View -> Controller`**

        This communication has to be blind and structured. 

        -   It has to be blind because these are generic view objects. The UI Button doesn't know anything about an concentration game controller, so when it's talking to the Controller, it doesn't really know that it's a Concentration game controller.
        -   It's structured in that since we're gonna have this communication going on, a generic object has to think a little bit ahead about how it might wanna communicate with this Controller object.

    -   **Target & action** 

    -   **protocol & delegate**

        Its delegate is just a var in scroll view that, and this var will have some object in it. And all we know about this object is that it responds to a certain number of messages. Most of these messages start with the words `will, should, did`

    -   **data source**

        It uses this same kind of protocol mechanism to have another set of special messages, and they are messages like data, give me the data **`data at & count`**

    3.  **`Model -> Controller`**

    -   **radio station model**

        The model starts broadcasting on a certain known radio station. And the controller up there it's just going to tune in and when it hears oh something's changed on the models radio station then it's gonna use its big green arrow, to go talk to the model and get the date of the change, or whatever. In iOS it's called `notifications, KVO(Key Valus Observing)`



# Struct & class

- ### Two major differences between a struct and a class

  1. Struct -> no inheritance 
  2. **the most important difference** is that structs are **value types **and class are **reference types**
  3. Struct only get copied when someone modifies it. That's called a copy-on-write semantics, that's the way Swift implements these value types.
  4. a class get a free init with no arguments as long as(只要) all of their vars are initialized
  5. a struct get a free initializer as well(也), but it's different than a class.
     - The free initializer they get, initializes all of their vars 
     - Even if they're already pre-initialized

## Internel name & externel name

- There are two names for a param(parametric [美: ,pærə'mɛtrɪk] [英: pærə'metrɪk]adj. [数][物] 参数的；[数][物] 参量的) in a func which are internal name and the external name.
- **an init func usually has the same internal name and the external name. They tend to.**

## tips

### *for* Loop :

- we use the word ,in, (and this right here can be anything in Swift that is a **sequence**)
  - **sequence**
    -  n. [数][计] 序列；顺序；续发事件([美: ˈsiːkwəns] [英: ˈsiːkwəns])
- A sequence in Swift means anything where you can start somewhere and go to the next one, go to the next one... that's the for loop dose

   

### Countable range :

- a countable range is a range ,in other words(换句话说)，it has a start and an end ,and it's countable.
- It knows how to count through it and go to the next space. (**0..<param**)

### ?? :
- this is very common for the optional syntax for choose a value if the value is set or a nil. So we can use the **??** (a special operator )
- `return optional.type ?? Value that if it’s nil`
- 

### Swift has type inference, Obviously swift can figure out from code

### Dictionary :
